### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jake. I'm a network security administrator that is looking to shift into the development space. I'm currently working through the "Odin Project" material.

You can follow my learning journey at [my hashnode blog](www.jakeconrad.dev)

I'd love to hear from other folks that are learning or who just want to connect.
